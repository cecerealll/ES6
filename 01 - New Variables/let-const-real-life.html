  // the window actually has a name attribute so if you made a global variable it might fck it up so what you could do is to run an IIFE and have the variable scoped to that
  (function() {
    // this variable will now not be avail globally
    var name = 'wes';
  })();

  // for let and const, we dont need an IIFE because they are block scoped
  {
    const name = 'wes';
    console.log(name);
  }


  for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
    setTimeout(function() {
      //  if it was using var, you will see an output of the number is 10, 10 times because the variable i is being overwritten everyime by the time the first setTime out runs, the i variable is already at the end 
      // by changing var to let which is block scoped it will scope the i to the for loop
      console.log('The number is ' + i);
    },1000);
  }

  // if the thing in the for loop was var , 
  // in the console you could call i and it's going to spit out 10 so first issue is that the variable has leaked out
