  console.log(pizza);
  const pizza = 'Deep Dish 🍕🍕🍕';

  // if console.log is above and you use var, it will return undefined, because you can access the value as they are defined, but you wont be able to access the value, if you change to const or let then itll say that pizza is not defined at all
