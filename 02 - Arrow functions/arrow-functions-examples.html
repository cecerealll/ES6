  const race = '100m Dash';
  const winners = ['Hunter Gath', 'Singa Song', 'Imda Bos'];

// return an object with map, i is passed thru as index
// when you wanna implicit return but you need the curly braces in there because u want your results to be an object add parantheses around, it indicates you want ot return an object literal, index is 0 based so you gotta add 1 so place starts with 1, win will be an array of objects, ES6 prop is if you have  a variable and value of the same name u could just type it once
  const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({name: winner, race, place: i + 1}));


  const ages = [23,62,45,234,2,62,234,62,34];

  const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
  console.log(old);
